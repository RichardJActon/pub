## Hiring the Staff

Some of our staff members are available to go "the extra mile", in exchange for a fee. The following services are available:

### Building an App

- Fee for just the App: 200 Euro
- Fee for an App which requires dependencies to be build/added to the catalog: 250 euro's + 200 euro's for every required dependency


### Adding features

We are open to add things like metrics exporters to Apps or adding features to the commonchart with a higher priority for the right price:

- Fee for adding a sidecart container: 100 Euro's
- Fee for modifying the Common Chart: 150 Euro's + 35 Euro's per hour for to-be-estimated amount of hours.

### Note on hiring

These fees are non-refundable and it might happen that your features or cannot be added due to upstream issues.
We and our staff are not liable in case this happens and no refunds will occur, because even failed attempts take time and development effort.


## Spending of funds:

Our goals are to pay our bills but also ensure project stability/future if anything happens to the primary members carying the project. To ensure those goals, we have the following funding priorities:

1. Paying the Bills

2. Ensure Ornias gains a minimum income

3. Ensure other maintainers gain a minimum income.

### Minimum Income

To ensure the project keeps running and active, we heavily rely on our maintainers. These people often put **many** hours each week into the project. To ensure they don't have to stop doing their work, we would, in the future, prefer to guarantee them a minimum income in line with the Dutch Full-Time minimum wage. However, this income will scale with donations and will not exceed the Dutch Full-Time minimum wage.

### Monthly income calculation

Every month the grants and costs will be subtracted from available funds as follows:

1. Substract all costs
2. Substract a max. of 500 Euro donation for the primary maintainer
3. Equally split the remaining monthly recurring(!) income between maintainers to a maximum of the Dutch minimum full-time wage (1750 Eur 2022).

## Donations

As we have no formal legal entity, all donations are handled by the project maintainer. Currently donations do not exceed a significant enough amount, to warrant a change to that policy.
