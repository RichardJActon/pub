# 01 - Adding TrueCharts to SCALE

Adding the TrueCharts Community App Catalog is relatively straight forwards.

##### Requirements

- Make sure your storage-pool is created and working
- Make sure you have a working internet connection and can reach github and truecharts.org from the host system.

##### Adding TrueCharts

When opening the Apps menu item on TrueNAS SCALE for the first time, you get prompted to setup a new pool for Apps.
This will create a new dataset on the selected pool called "ix-applications", which will contain all docker containers and most application data, unless specified otherwise.

- Go to "Apps" in the left hand menu
- Select the "Manage Catalogs" tab
- Click "Add Catalog" and enter the required information:

- Name: `truecharts`
- Repository: `https://github.com/truecharts/catalog`
- Preferred Trains: `stable` and `core`
- Branch: `main`

##### Difference between Stable and Incubator

TrueCharts has multiple "trains": All trains contain Apps that should work fine. However they have a slightly different meaning:

- `stable` contains most of our Apps. These are considered stable and working.
- `core` contains important Apps that are used to supply features like "ingress" or advanced networking to our Apps.
- `games` contains game servers
- `dependency` contains apps that are mostly used as dependecies. This train is not supported, besides from bug fixes.
- `incubator` These Apps are still in development and/or are not considered to be of high-enough quality.
