# Apps Development Suggestions

The goal is to gather some suggestions and forward them to iX-Systems.

For easy reference the priorities are linked to a future release for reference purposes and should be read as "The following release or earlier".
When given a priority the following is taken into account:

- The amount of complaints about something

- How invasive the change is, most likely, going to be vs. the time till the aimed release.

- If there are any TrueCharts features that are currently "on-hold" or struggling, due to the lack of a certain feature

- The added value a feature is going to have for TrueNAS SCALE
