Overview: "Headless Steam Service\r\nPlay your games in the browser with audio. Connect\
  \ another device and use it with Steam Remote Play. \r\n\r\n## Features:\r\n- Full\
  \ video/audio noVNC web access to a Xfce4 Desktop\r\n- NVIDIA GPU support\r\n- Full\
  \ controller support (requires ich777's uinput plugin installed)\r\n- SSH server\
  \ for remote terminal access (port 2222)\r\n- Root access\r\n- Based on Debain Bullseye\r\
  \n\r\n---\r\n## Notes:\r\n\r\n### ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE:\r\nIf you wish to install\
  \ additional applications, you can generate a\r\nscript inside the `~/init.d` directory\
  \ ending with \".sh\". This will be executed on the container startup.\r\n\r\n###\
  \ STORAGE PATHS:\r\nEverything that you wish to save in this container should be\
  \ stored in the home directory or a docker container mount that you have specified.\
  \ All files that are store outside your home directory are not persistent and will\
  \ be wiped if there is an update of the container or you change something in the\
  \ template.\r\n\r\n### GAMES LIBRARY:\r\nIt is recommended that you mount your games\
  \ library to `/mnt/games` and configure Steam to add that path.\r\n\r\n### AUTO\
  \ START APPLICATIONS:\r\nIn this container, Steam is configured to automatically\
  \ start. If you wish to add additional services to automatically start, add them\
  \ under **Applications &gt; Settings &gt; Session and Startup** in the WebUI.\r\n\
  \r\n### NETWORK MODE:\r\nIf you want to use the container as a Steam Remote Play\
  \ (previously \"In Home Streaming\") host device you should set the **\"Network\
  \ Type:\"** to *\"Host\"*. This is a requirement for controller hardware to work\
  \ and to prevent traffic being routed through the internet since Steam thinks you\
  \ are on a different network.\r\n\r\n### NVIDIA GPU:\r\nTo enable NVIDIA GPU support,\
  \ ensure that you have installed the **Nvidia-Driver** plugin and add the *\"--runtime=nvidia\"\
  * parameter added to **\"Extra Parameters:\"**\r\n\r\n### AMD GPU:\r\nTo enable\
  \ AMD GPU support, ensure that you have installed the **Radeon-TOP** plugin.\r\n\
  \r\n### USING HOST X SERVER:\r\nIf your host is already running X, you can just\
  \ use that. To do this, be sure to configure:\r\n  - DISPLAY=:0    \r\n    **(Variable)**\
  \ - *Configures the sceen to use the primary display. Set this to whatever your\
  \ host is using*\r\n  - MODE=secondary    \r\n    **(Variable)** - *Configures the\
  \ container to not start an X server of its own*\r\n  - HOST_DBUS=true    \r\n \
  \   **(Variable)** - *Optional - Configures the container to use the host dbus process*\r\
  \n  - /run/dbus:/run/dbus:ro    \r\n    **(Mount)**  - *Optional - Configures the\
  \ container to use the host dbus process*"
