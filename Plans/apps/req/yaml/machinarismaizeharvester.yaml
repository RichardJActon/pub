Overview: "On a secondary Unraid system, allows for harvesting of local Chia plots.\
  \  Connects to the main Machinaris application.\r\n  \r\n  PREREQUISITE: On another\
  \ machine! Install the Machinaris applicatione, which this harvester container will\
  \ connect with.\r\n  \r\n  WARNING: Do NOT install this harvester on the same system\
  \ as you installed the fullnode.  The fullnode already runs a harvester internally.\
  \  This harvester software is for a second physical server.\r\n  \r\n  INSTALL:\
  \ Set the host path to first directory containing plots using '/plots1' Path. Add\
  \ more Paths for additional host directories. Also be sure to set the LAN IP address\
  \ of your Unraid server in the controller_host, farmer_address  and worker_address\
  \ variables.\r\n  \r\n  SETUP: Control of this harvester will be available within\
  \ the Machinaris WebUI.\r\n  \r\n  SUPPORT: Join the Discord server for fastest\
