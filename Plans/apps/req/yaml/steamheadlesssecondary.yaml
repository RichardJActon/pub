Overview: "Headless Steam Service (Secondary)\r\nThis container relies on an existing\
  \ working SteamHeadless running.\r\n\r\n## Features:\r\n- Run a second (or third\
  \ or fourth) instance of steam on the Steam Headless desktop.\r\n- All the same\
  \ features as Steam Headless accessed through an existing Steam Headless container\r\
  \n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Notes:\r\n\r\n### NETWORK TYPE:\r\nEach instance of this container\
  \ should be run on a \"**Custom: br0**\" network and should be configured with a\
  \ unique \"**Fixed IP address**\".\r\n\r\n### RUNNING MULTIPLE INSTANCES:\r\nOnly\
  \ one instance of Steam Headless can play a game at any time. If you start a second\
  \ Remote Play link, it wil hijack the virtual monitor, and all input devices from\
  \ the first one.\r\n\r\n### STORAGE PATHS:\r\nEverything that you wish to save in\
  \ this container should be stored in the home directory or a docker container mount\
  \ that you have specified. All files that are store outside your home directory\
  \ are not persistent and will be wiped if there is an update of the container or\
  \ you change something in the template.\r\n\r\n### GAMES LIBRARY:\r\nIt is recommended\
  \ that you mount your games library to `/mnt/games` and configure Steam to add that\
  \ path.\r\n\r\n### NVIDIA GPU:\r\nTo enable NVIDIA GPU support, ensure that you\
  \ have the *\"--runtime=nvidia\"* parameter added to **\"Extra Parameters:\"**"
