Overview: "This project monitors the UDP socket (50222) from a WeatherFlow Hub, and\
  \ publishes the data to a MQTT Server. Data is formatted in a way that, it supports\
  \ the MQTT Discovery format for Home Assistant, so a sensor will created for each\
  \ entity that WeatherFlow sends out, if you have MQTT Discovery enabled.\r\n"
