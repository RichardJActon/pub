It provides a web interface for managing nonspecific files.\r\n\r\nOpenKM is a management solution that allows businesses to control the production, storage, management and distribution of electronic documents, yielding greater effectiveness and the ability to reuse information and to control the flow of the documents.\r\n\r\nThe CE version of OpenKM doesn't have any trial period or something similar. It's the Open Source version (free) developed and maintained by the public community, but with the lack of some of the features that are only available in the Cloud or Professional editions (paid). But, with some little tricks and programming skills, the user can modify its source code (public).\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\u2022 The program has a built-in SQLite DB (embedded), but if you're going to use it for production it's highly recommended to connect it to an external DB, such as: MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL (and others). By default, if no database is configured to connect to the OpenKM instance, it will use the integrated one.\r\n\u2022 Both, 'OpenKM.cfg' and 'server.xml' files, MUST be present and properly configured before creating the container.\r\n\u2022 The 'Repository (data)' is the storage location for all the data (docs) uploaded through the platform.\r\n\u2022 If there is a new image version and you want to update it to the latest (tag), you will need to backup all the data (repo, metadata, DB...) before proceeding with the process. DO NOT update if you didn't back up previous installation.\r\n\u2022 The default credentials are: okmAdmin/admin (Administrator).\r\n\u2022 The '/HOST_SWAP' directory is mapped to the internal storage of the container to allow communication between the container and the host. It will be usefull in case of exporting repo (zip) or any file from within the platform, to the host.
