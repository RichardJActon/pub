On Unraid this can lead to errors if the User is nonexistent on the Hostsystem. I haven't found a easy workaround yet but the specified User PUID is 1000 which on Unraid is the first User created when using the Users option in the GUI to add a user. So you could create a new user if you get errors but it feels very sketchy. Also note that the Docker will write it's files with that PUID.\n\r\n\r\nRead the Readme's first.\r\nTachidesk: https://github.com/Suwayomi/Tachidesk-Server\r\nTachidesk-Docker: https://github.com/suwayomi/docker-tachidesk\r\n\r\n\r\n(Excert from official Tachidesk Readme.

Think of it roughly like the concept of \"distribution\" in GNU/Linux distributions, in which Linux(Tachidesk-Server) is the kernel and the difference is which desktop environment(Tachidesk client) you get with it.\r\n\r\nTachidesk-Server is as multi-platform as you can get. Any platform that runs java and/or has a modern browser can run it. This includes Windows, Linux, macOS, chrome OS, etc. Follow Downloading and Running the app for installation instructions.\r\n\r\nAbility to sync with Tachiyomi is a planned feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Excert from official Tachidesk-Docker Readme.
