[br]\r\n    It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. [br]\r\n    It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required [br]\r\n    and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. For example, it has been used in sensors [br]\r\n    communicating to a broker via satellite link, over occasional dial-up connections with [br]\r\n    healthcare providers, and in a range of home automation and small device scenarios. [br]\r\n    It is also ideal for mobile applications because of its small size, low power usage, [br]\r\n    minimised data packets, and efficient distribution of information to one or many receivers[br]\r\n    [br][br][br]\r\n    This version supports passwords - see passwords.README in the /config directory.[br]\r\n    Also supported are websockets and certificates.[br]\r\n    [br]\r\n    The docker is built on a LinuxServer.io template, but be assured that any bugs are mine!.[br]", "WebUI": "http://mqtt.org/", "TemplateURL": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spants/unraidtemplates/master/Spants/MQTT.xml", "Icon": "https://i.imgur.com/Cc9Jkcr.png", "PostArgs": "", "Networking": {"Mode": "bridge"}, "Repo": "Spants' Repository", "CategoryList": ["HomeAutomation"], "Video": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y06G853Udg", "LastUpdateScan": 1648411395, "LastUpdate": 1581501495, "FirstSeen": 1491451200, "topTrending": -3.6470000000000002, "topPerforming": 0.407, "Config": {"Port": {"Port 1": {"value": "1883", "Name": "Port 1", "Target": "1883", "Default": "1883", "Mode": "tcp", "Description": "Container Port: 1883", "Type": "Port", "Display": "always", "Required": "true", "Mask": "false"}, "Port 2": {"value": "9001", "Name": "Port 2", "Target": "9001", "Default": "9001", "Mode": "tcp", "Description": "Container Port: 9001", "Type": "Port", "Display": "always", "Required": "true", "Mask": "false"}}, "Variable": {}, "Path": {"AppData Config Path": {"value": "/mnt/user/appdata/MQTT", "Name": "AppData Config Path", "Target": "/config", "Default": "/mnt/user/docker/appdata/MQTT", "Mode": "rw", "Description": "Container Path: /config", "Type": "Path", "Display": "advanced-hide", "Required": "true", "Mask": "false"}}, "Device": {}, "Label": {}}}
