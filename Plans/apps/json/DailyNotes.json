The closest thing I've seen to an app for replacing this system is Noteplan, but I don't use a Mac or an iOS device, and it's not self-hostable, so I decided to write my own.\n\r\rSince I had the need for keeping track of to-dos throughout the day, regular Markdown didn't work for me since it doesn't natively support tasks. So as an alternative I'm using Github Flavored Markdown (GFM). I really wanted it to feel like an actual text editor and not just a textbox, so I decided to use CodeMirror to handle all the input. Fira Code is used to provide font ligatures. Some other nice features include code highlighting, text/code folding, and a task list where you can toggle the status of any task from any date or note.", "WebUI": "http://[IP]:[PORT:5000]/", "TemplateURL": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m0ngr31/unraid_ca/master/DailyNotes.xml", "Icon": "https://i.imgur.com/AI8bd73.png", "PostArgs": "", "Networking": {"Mode": "bridge"}, "Repo": "m0ngr31's Repository", "topTrending": -16.361, "Config": {"Port": {"Container Port": {"value": "5000", "Name": "Container Port", "Target": "5000", "Default": "5000", "Mode": "tcp", "Description": "Container Port: 5000", "Type": "Port", "Display": "always", "Required": "true", "Mask": "false"}}, "Variable": {"Prevent Signups?": {"value": "", "Name": "Prevent Signups?", "Target": "PREVENT_SIGNUPS", "Default": "", "Mode": "", "Description": "Disable signup form?
