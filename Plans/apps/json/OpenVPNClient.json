If you want to enable it turn on 'Advanced View' and delete the entry: '--sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0' from the 'Extra Parameters'.\r\n\r\nADVANCED CONFIG: If you leave the appdata directory for this container empty it will start up and you have to manually configure it with the builtin comand: 'openvpn.sh', see: https://github.com/ich777/docker-openvpn-client", "WebUI": "", "Icon": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ich777/docker-templates/master/ich777/images/openvpn-client.png", "ExtraParams": "--cap-add=NET_ADMIN --dns=8.8.8.8 --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0", "PostArgs": "", "Networking": {"Mode": "bridge"}, "Config": [{"@attributes": {"Name": "Data Path", "Target": "/vpn", "Default": "", "Mode": "rw", "Description": "Data Path for your 'vpn.ovpn' and your certificates or your 'vpn.auth'.", "Type": "Path", "Display": "always", "Required": "true", "Mask": "false"}, "value": "/mnt/cache/appdata/openvpn-client"}, {"@attributes": {"Name": "TUN device", "Target": "", "Default": "", "Mode": "", "Description": "TUN device that is needed to run the container.", "Type": "Device", "Display": "advanced", "Required": "true", "Mask": "false"}, "value": "/dev/net/tun"}], "Repo": "ich777's Repository", "caTemplateURL": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ich777/docker-templates/master/ich777/OpenVPN-Client.xml", "CategoryList": ["Network-VPN"], "Video": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1y06G853Udg", "LastUpdateScan": 1646917410, "LastUpdate": 1643018136, "FirstSeen": 1641719003}
