Overview: "DESCRIPTION\r\nEuterpe is a self-hosted streaming service for music. Formerly\
  \ known as \"HTTPMS (HTTP Media Server)\".\r\n\r\nA way to listen to your music\
  \ library from everywhere. Once set up you won't need anything but a browser. Think\
  \ of it as your own Spotify service over which you have full control. Euterpe will\
  \ let you browse through and listen to your music over HTTP(s). Up until now I've\
  \ had a really bad time listening to my music which is stored back home. I would\
  \ create a mount over ftp, sshfs or something similar and point the local player\
  \ to the mounted library. Every time it resulted in some upleasantries. Just imagine\
  \ searching in a network mounted directory!\r\n\r\nLive demo:\r\nhttps://listen-to-euterpe.eu/demo\r\
  \n\r\nNOTES\r\n\u2022 Check out the different clients that you can use with Euterpe:\
  \ 'https://listen-to-euterpe.eu/clients'.\r\n\u2022 You can also use a 'config.json'\
  \ file to manage its configuration, if decided. Check the 'Configuration' section\
  \ from the documentation to know more.\r\n\u2022 Currently, I'm facing some problems\
  \ when trying to mount the '/root/.euterpe' container dir, and that's why I didn't\
  \ add the path to the template. You can follow the issue on GitHub: 'https://github.com/ironsmile/euterpe/issues/42'.\r\
  \n\r\nVERSION\r\n1.0 (2022-01-31)"
