Overview: "HexChat is an IRC client based on XChat, but unlike XChat it\u2019s completely\
  \ free for both Windows and Unix-like systems. Since XChat is open source, it\u2019\
  s perfectly legal. For more info. HexChat was originally called XChat-WDK which\
  \ in turn was a successor of freakschat."
