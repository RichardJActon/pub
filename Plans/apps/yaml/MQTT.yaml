Overview: "MQTT for Unraid6 Docker Manager running on Port 1883 and 9001[br][br]\r\
  \n    MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/\"Internet of Things\" connectivity protocol.\
  \ [br]\r\n    It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging\
  \ transport. [br]\r\n    It is useful for connections with remote locations where\
  \ a small code footprint is required [br]\r\n    and/or network bandwidth is at\
  \ a premium. For example, it has been used in sensors [br]\r\n    communicating\
  \ to a broker via satellite link, over occasional dial-up connections with [br]\r\
  \n    healthcare providers, and in a range of home automation and small device scenarios.\
  \ [br]\r\n    It is also ideal for mobile applications because of its small size,\
  \ low power usage, [br]\r\n    minimised data packets, and efficient distribution\
  \ of information to one or many receivers[br]\r\n    [br][br][br]\r\n    This version\
  \ supports passwords - see passwords.README in the /config directory.[br]\r\n  \
  \  Also supported are websockets and certificates.[br]\r\n    [br]\r\n    The docker\
  \ is built on a LinuxServer.io template, but be assured that any bugs are mine!.[br]"
