Overview: TasUI is a zero-install device management interface web application for
  all your Tasmota devices. It will discover your deployed devices and allow you to
  set up and configure every device from a single dashboard. This initial version
  includes multiple views (Control, Health, Firmware, Wi-Fi, &amp; MQTT) to allow
  you to quickly assess the state of your devices. There is also a detailed view (e.g.,
  SetOptions, Status, etc.) available.
