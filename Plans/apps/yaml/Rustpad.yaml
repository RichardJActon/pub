Overview: "DESCRIPTION\r\nRustpad is an efficient and minimal open-source collaborative\
  \ text editor based on the operational transformation algorithm. It lets users collaborate\
  \ in real time while writing code in their browser. Rustpad is completely self-hosted\
  \ and no database is required.\r\n\r\nThe server is written in Rust using the warp\
  \ web server framework and the operational-transform library. We use wasm-bindgen\
  \ to compile text operation logic to WebAssembly code, which runs in the browser.\
  \ The frontend is written in TypeScript using React and interfaces with Monaco,\
  \ the text editor that powers VS Code.\r\n\r\nArchitecturally, client-side code\
  \ communicates via WebSocket with a central server that stores in-memory data structures.\
  \ This makes the editor very fast, allows us to avoid provisioning a database, and\
  \ makes testing much easier. The tradeoff is that documents are transient and lost\
  \ between server restarts, after 24 hours of inactivity or any other given time\
  \ in days.\r\n\r\nLive demo:\r\nhttps://rustpad.io/\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\u2022 If you\
  \ want the data to be persistent in case of service restart, create the '/.../appdata/rustpad'\
  \ dir, and place the DB file located on my GitHub repo: 'https://github.com/SmartPhoneLover/unraid-docker-templates/raw/main/templates/dependencies/rustpad/rustpad_db.zip',\
  \ before building the container. Or, you can create your own SQLite DB file if you\
  \ prefer (empty, no tables nor columns).\r\n\u2022 If you don't want the data to\
  \ be persistent in case of service restart, just delete 'SQLITE_URI' and 'Storage\
  \ (database)' settings from this template.\r\n\u2022 The container was and stills\
  \ being originally designed to be non-persistent (data) after service restart or\
  \ after a given time, so all information that the user could enter through its interface\
  \ will be treated as volatile. But, it supports the use of SQLite DB to allow it\
  \ to retain data in case of service restart (only).\r\n\r\nVERSION\r\n1.0 (2022-01-29)"
