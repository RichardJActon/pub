Overview: "This Docker will download and install SteamCMD. It will also install Valheim\
  \ and run it.\r\n\r\nATTENTION: First Startup can take very long since it downloads\
  \ the gameserver files!\r\n\r\nSERVER BROWSER: It could take really long that the\
  \ server shows up in the in game server list, if you want to connect directly simply\
  \ go to the Steam Server Browser - View -> Servers -> Favourites -> Add Server ->\
  \ SERVERIP:SERVERPORT+1 (eg: if the server port is 2456 then you have to enter something\
  \ like: 192.168.0.1:2457) -> click on Add -> click on more time on Refresh, after\
  \ that you can connect to the server with a double click.\r\n\r\nUpdate Notice:\
  \ Simply restart the container if a newer version of the game is available.\r\n\r\
  \nYou can also run multiple servers with only one SteamCMD directory!"
