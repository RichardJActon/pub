ModeratorComment: Effective Duplicate of teamspeak-alpine.  Only base OS differs
Name: teamspeak-debian
Overview: "TeamSpeak is proprietary voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) software that\
  \ allows computer users to speak on a chat channel with fellow computer users, much\
  \ like a telephone conference call. A TeamSpeak user will often wear a headset with\
  \ an integrated microphone. Users use the TeamSpeak client software to connect to\
  \ a TeamSpeak server of their choice, from there they can join chat channels and\
  \ discuss things.[br][br]\r\n[b][u][span style='color: #E80000;']Configuration[/span][/u][/b][br]\n\
  [b]/ts3-debian[/b] This is where teamspeak will store it's configuration file, database\
  \ and logs.[br][br]\r\n[b][u][span style='color: #E80000;']Notes[/span][/u][/b][br]\n\
  Connect to the server using the TeamSpeak client with the host IP address and port\
  \ 9987.[br]\nTo authenticate use the privilege key shown in the supervisord.log\
  \ file in the /ts3-debian folder."
