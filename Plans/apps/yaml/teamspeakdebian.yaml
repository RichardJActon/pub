Name: teamspeak-debian
Overview: "TeamSpeak is proprietary voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) software that\
  \ allows computer users to speak on a chat channel with fellow computer users, much\
  \ like a telephone conference call. A TeamSpeak user will often wear a headset with\
  \ an integrated microphone. Users use the TeamSpeak client software to connect to\
  \ a TeamSpeak server of their choice, from there they can join chat channels and\
  \ discuss things.[br][br]\r\n"
