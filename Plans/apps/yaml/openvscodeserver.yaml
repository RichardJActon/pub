Overview: "VS Code has traditionally been a desktop IDE built with web technologies.\
  \ A few years back, people started patching it in order to run it in a remote context\
  \ and to make it accessible through web browsers. These efforts have been complex\
  \ and error prone, because many changes had to be made across the large code base\
  \ of VS Code.\r\n"
