Overview: "VS Code has traditionally been a desktop IDE built with web technologies.\
  \ A few years back, people started patching it in order to run it in a remote context\
  \ and to make it accessible through web browsers. These efforts have been complex\
  \ and error prone, because many changes had to be made across the large code base\
  \ of VS Code.\r\n\r\nLuckily, in 2019 the VS Code team started to refactor its architecture\
  \ to support a browser-based working mode. While this architecture has been adopted\
  \ by Gitpod and GitHub, the important bits have not been open-sourced, until now.\
  \ As a result, many people in the community still use the old, hard to maintain\
  \ and error-prone approach.\r\n\r\nAt Gitpod, we've been asked a lot about how we\
  \ do it. So we thought we might as well share the minimal set of changes needed\
  \ so people can rely on the latest version of VS Code, have a straightforward upgrade\
  \ path and low maintenance effort.\r\n\r\n\_\u26A0\uFE0F Be careful, each time you\
  \ create or update the docker, everything is reset (except the share folder)."
