Overview: Containerised version of PhoenixMiner. Helps turn your Unraid server into
  an Ethereum / cryptocurrency mining rig. Contains AMD drivers. Not affected by the
  AMD reset bug as it doesn't rely on vfio. Works with most Nvidia GPUs as well via
  Open Source drivers. Check the support link for detailed installation instructions.
