Overview: "Airsonic is a free, web-based media streamer, providing ubiquitious access\
  \ to your music. Use it to share your music with friends, or to listen to your own\
  \ music while at work. You can stream to multiple players simultaneously, for instance\
  \ to one player in your kitchen and another in your living room.[br]\n    Airsonic\
  \ is designed to handle very large music collections (hundreds of gigabytes). Although\
  \ optimized for MP3 streaming, it works for any audio or video format that can stream\
  \ over HTTP, for instance AAC and OGG. By using transcoder plug-ins, Airsonic supports\
  \ on-the-fly conversion and streaming of virtually any audio format, including WMA,\
  \ FLAC, APE, Musepack, WavPck and Shorten.[br]\n    If you have constrained bandwidth,\
  \ you may set an upper limit for the bitrate of the music streams. Airsonic will\
  \ then automatically resample the music to a suitable bitrate.[br]\n    In addition\
  \ to being a streaming media server, Airsonic works very well as a local jukebox.\
  \ The intuitive web interface, as well as search and index facilities, are optimized\
  \ for efficient browsing through large media libraries. Airsonic also comes with\
  \ an integrated Podcast receiver, with many of the same features as you find in\
  \ iTunes.[br]\n    Based on Java technology, Airsonic runs on most platforms, including\
  \ Windows, Mac, Linux and Unix variants.[br][br]"
