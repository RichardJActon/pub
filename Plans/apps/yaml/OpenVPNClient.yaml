Overview: "This OpenVPN container was designed to be started first to provide a connection\
  \ to other containers (using '--net=container:OpenVPN-Client'), see the documentation\
  \ for further help here: https://github.com/ich777/docker-openvpn-client\r\n\r\n\
  The basic steps for a OpenVPN connection that requires a Username and Password are:\
  \ 1) Rename your *.ovpn to 'vpn.ovpn' and place it in your OpenVPN-Client directory,\
  \ 2) Create in the same directory a file named 'vpn.auth' and place your Username\
  \ in the first line and the Password for the connection in the second line and save\
  \ it 3) Restart the container open the logs and see if the connection to your VPN\
  \ establishes successfully.\r\n\r\nTo tunnel traffic from another container through\
  \ this container edit the template from the other container, set the 'Network Type'\
  \ to: 'None', enable the advanced view in the top right corner and at 'Extra Parameters'\
  \ add the following: '--net=container:OpenVPN-Client' (replace 'OpenVPN-Client'\
  \ with the name of this container if you choose a different name for it) and write\
  \ down the port(s) that you need to connect to.\r\nAfter that go back to edit this\
  \ containers template and add the port that you have noted in the above step to\
  \ this container and click 'Apply' now you can connect to the container that you\
  \ tunneld the traffic though this container.\r\n\r\nYou can route the traffic from\
  \ multiple containers through this container with the steps above, if you need more\
  \ ports then simply add more ports in this containers template.\r\n\r\nDNS: By default\
  \ this container uses Googles DNS Server: 8.8.8.8 if you want to edit this turn\
  \ on 'Advanced View' and edit this setting at 'Extra Parameters'.\r\n\r\nIPv6: By\
  \ default IPv6 is disabled in this container. If you want to enable it turn on 'Advanced\
  \ View' and delete the entry: '--sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0' from the\
  \ 'Extra Parameters'.\r\n\r\nADVANCED CONFIG: If you leave the appdata directory\
  \ for this container empty it will start up and you have to manually configure it\
  \ with the builtin comand: 'openvpn.sh', see: https://github.com/ich777/docker-openvpn-client"
