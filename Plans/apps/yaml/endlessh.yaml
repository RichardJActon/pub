Network: bridge
Overview: Endlessh(https://github.com/skeeto/endlessh) is an SSH tarpit that very
  slowly sends an endless, random SSH banner. It keeps SSH clients locked up for hours
  or even days at a time. The purpose is to put your real SSH server on another port
  and then let the script kiddies get stuck in this tarpit instead of bothering a
  real server.
