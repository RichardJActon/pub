Overview: "Privoxy is a free non-caching web proxy with filtering capabilities for\
  \ enhancing privacy, manipulating cookies and modifying web page data and HTTP headers\
  \ before the page is rendered by the browser. Privoxy is a \"privacy enhancing proxy\"\
  , filtering web pages and removing advertisements. Privoxy can be customized by\
  \ users, for both stand-alone systems and multi-user networks. Privoxy can be chained\
  \ to other proxies and is frequently used in combination with Squid and can be used\
  \ to bypass Internet censorship.\n    microsocks is a SOCKS5 service that you can\
  \ run on your remote boxes to tunnel connections through them, if for some reason\
  \ SSH doesn't cut it for you. It's very lightweight, and very light on resources\
  \ too: for every client, a thread with a stack size of 8KB is spawned. the main\
  \ process basically doesn't consume any resources at all. The only limits are the\
  \ amount of file descriptors and the RAM.\n    This Docker includes OpenVPN and\
  \ WireGuard to ensure a secure and private connection to the Internet, including\
  \ use of iptables to prevent IP leakage when the tunnel is down."
