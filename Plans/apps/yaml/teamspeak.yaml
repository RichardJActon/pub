Overview: TeamSpeak is proprietary voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) software that
  allows computer users to speak on a chat channel with fellow computer users, much
  like a telephone conference call. A TeamSpeak user will often wear a headset with
  an integrated microphone. Users use the TeamSpeak client software to connect to
  a TeamSpeak server of their choice, from there they can join chat channels and discuss
  things.
