Overview: "This Docker will download and install Quake III Server (You have to copy\
  \ your .pk3 files from your game directory to your server).\r\n\r\nPK3 Files: After\
  \ the container started the first time you have to copy your pak*.pk3 files from\
  \ your Quake III Arena directory into your server directory: .../.q3a/baseq3/ (i\
  \ strongly recommend you to place all your pak*.pk3 files into it) after that simply\
  \ restart the container and it would start the server.\r\n\r\nConfiguring the server:\
  \ Your server.cfg and maprotationfile.cfg is located into your server directory\
  \ and .../.q3a/baseq/ (after you successfully started the Quake III Server once)."
