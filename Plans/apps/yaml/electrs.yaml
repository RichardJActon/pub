Overview: "Serve your Electrum clients from your own Bitcoin node! Avoid trusting\
  \ public Electrum nodes, and maintain your own privacy.\n    [br][br]\n    Electrs\
  \ does not support encrypted (SSL) communication, so avoid connecting directly to\
  \ the TCP port over public networks (eg the Internet). Note that some clients, including\
  \ Electrum, do not support connections without SSL. Consider using nginx as an SSL\
  \ proxy (see link below for sample configuration). Electrs is designed for personal\
  \ use only, and is not appropriate for serving a large number of clients.\n    [br]\n\
  \    If you have RPC enabled in Bitcoin Core without manually specifying an RPC\
  \ user and password, Electrs can use Bitcoin's cookie file to auth automatically.\
  \ If you have manually configured user and password in Bitcoin, these must also\
  \ be set in Electrs manually. To do so, create a file called electrs.toml in the\
  \ Electrs Data directory configured below. In this file, include the following data,\
  \ substituting your own values for USER and PASSWORD: auth = \"USER:PASSWORD\"\n\
  \    [br]\n    See https://github.com/romanz/electrs/blob/master/doc/usage.md for\
  \ full details on Electrs configuration."
