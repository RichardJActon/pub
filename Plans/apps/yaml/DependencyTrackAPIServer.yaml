Overview: "API Server to be used with Dependency-Track Front-End\r\nDependency-Track\
  \ is an intelligent Component Analysis platform that allows organizations to identify\
  \ and reduce risk in the software supply chain. Dependency-Track takes a unique\
  \ and highly beneficial approach by leveraging the capabilities of Software Bill\
  \ of Materials (SBOM). This approach provides capabilities that traditional Software\
  \ Composition Analysis (SCA) solutions cannot achieve.\r\nFor more details about\
  \ Dependency-Track see the projects website at dependencytrack.org Please note this\
  \ application is not lightweight and uses 8-12GB of ram to run"
