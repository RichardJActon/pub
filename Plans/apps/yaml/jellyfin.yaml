Overview: "DESCRIPTION\r\nThis docker template is based on the official Jellyfin image\
  \ (jellyfin/jellyfin), without modifications. Just in case you wanna try it and\
  \ compare to the other ones available.\r\n\r\nJellyfin is the volunteer-built media\
  \ solution that puts you in control of your media. Stream to any device from your\
  \ own server, with no strings attached. Your media, your server, your way.\r\n\r\
  \nJellyfin is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control of managing\
  \ and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex,\
  \ to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps.\
  \ Jellyfin is descended from Emby's 3.5.2 release and ported to the .NET Core framework\
  \ to enable full cross-platform support. There are no strings attached, no premium\
  \ licenses or features, and no hidden agendas: just a team who want to build something\
  \ better and work together to achieve it. We welcome anyone who is interested in\
  \ joining us in our quest!\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\u2022 Native images (this case) not\
  \ always are the best options. Other ones could have specific modifications that\
  \ adds some features not yet implemented on the official, for example: 'linuxserver/jellyfin',\
  \ which supports HW acceleration for installation in other plataforms, like: ARM\
  \ devices. The final decsion is only yours.\r\n\u2022 It's recommended to set all\
  \ the library paths to 'Read Only' permission, just for security reasons. But, it's\
  \ up to you.\r\n\u2022 There are no predefined library paths that must be set to\
  \ allow Jellyfin to detect media content, and there's no limit for the number of\
  \ them. The user can create as many paths as libraries it could have to best organize\
  \ the media.\r\n\r\nVERSION\r\n1.1 (2021-12-14)"
