Overview: BitTorrent Sync, or simply - Sync - is an application for data synchronization.
  Its primary goal is to keep designated folder content same on 2 or more devices
  / computers. As soon as something changes on one computer, change (would it be changed
  content of a file, file renaming or deletion, etc.) should be propagated to all
  other computer(s) that want to keep the folder synchronized. Sync is available for
  a bunch of platforms, both desktop and mobile, which gives a good usage flexibility.
