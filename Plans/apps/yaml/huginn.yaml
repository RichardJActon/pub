Overview: "Build agents that monitor and act on your behalf. Your agents are standing\
  \ by! \r\n[br][br]\r\nHuginn is a system for building agents that perform automated\
  \ tasks for you online. They can read the web, watch for events, and take actions\
  \ on your behalf. Huginn's Agents create and consume events, propagating them along\
  \ a directed graph. Think of it as a hackable version of IFTTT or Zapier on your\
  \ own server. You always know who has your data. You do.\r\n[br][br]\r\nLog in to\
  \ your Huginn instance using the username admin and password password\r\n[br][br]\r\
  \nSee https://hub.docker.com/r/huginn/huginn/ for more information on running Huginn\
  \ with a separate database container \r\n[br][br]\r\nMore variables can be found\
  \ here: https://github.com/huginn/huginn/blob/master/.env.example"
