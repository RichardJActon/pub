Overview: "Check out the wiki for making config files for your steam account.\r\n\
  https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki\r\n\r\nASF is a C# application\
  \ with primary purpose of idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously.\
  \ Unlike Idle Master which works only for one account at given time, while requiring\
  \ Steam client running in the background and launching additional processes imitating\
  \ \"game playing\" status, ASF doesn't require any Steam client running in the background,\
  \ doesn't launch any additional processes and is made to handle unlimited Steam\
  \ accounts at once. In addition to that, it's meant to be run on servers or other\
  \ desktop-less machines, and features full cross-OS support, which makes it possible\
  \ to launch on any operating system with .NET Core runtime, such as Windows, Linux\
  \ and OS X. ASF is possible thanks to gigantic amount of work done in marvelous\
  \ SteamKit2 library.\r\n\r\nToday, ASF is one of the most versatile Steam power\
  \ tools, allowing you to make use of many features that were implemented over time.\
  \ Apart from idling Steam cards, which remains the primary focus, ASF includes bunch\
  \ of features on its own, such as a possibility to use it as Steam authenticator\
  \ or chat logger. In addition to that, ASF includes plugin system, thanks to which\
  \ anybody can further extend it to his/her needs."
