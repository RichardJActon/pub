Overview: "A standalone dashboard page showing the status of the checks in your Healthchecks.io\
  \ account.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS: Enable the \"Advanced View\" in the top right of\
  \ the container setup page, and add your *VIEW ONLY* API key from Healthchecks.io\
  \ settings page in the \"WebUI\" portion.  You can then change \"Label\" to anything\
  \ you would like in order to have it show above your checks, or omit it all together,\
  \ and lastly you can change from the light theme to a dark theme. All this needs\
  \ to be done on the \"WebUI\" portion so you can easily launch it from your container\
  \ list."
