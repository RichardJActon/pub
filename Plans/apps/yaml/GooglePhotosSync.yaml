Overview: "Google Photos Sync downloads your Google Photos to the local file system.\
  \ It will backup all the photos the user uploaded to Google Photos, but also the\
  \ album information and additional Google Photos 'Creations' (animations, panoramas,\
  \ movies, effects and collages).\r\n\r\nHow to set this up:\r\n1. Place your client_secret.json\
  \ at /config\r\n    How to get it is best described at Logix's Article at Linux\
  \ Uprising\r\n2. Afterwards you need to sign into the application once which cannot\
  \ be done headlessly (using the \"Syncing\" command)\r\n3. Afterwards you can call\
  \ the \"Syncing\" command any time you wish, as long as the container is running\
  \ (e.g. by using cron).\r\n\r\nSyncing:\r\n[i]docker exec -it GooglePhotosSync gphotos-sync\
  \ /storage[/i]\r\nBy itself this container will do nothing. A sync will only occur\
  \ when you call the above command on a running container."
