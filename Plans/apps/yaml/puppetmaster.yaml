Overview: "Simple puppet master docker based on Centos7\n  # docker-puppetmaster\n\
  \  Docker image for puppet server v5 designed to run on unraid\n  If you want the\
  \ 3.5 version please use docker-puppetmaster:v3 which is currently using puppet\
  \ 3.5.7\n\n  This is super basic, you have to map /etc/puppet and /etc/puppet/ssl\
  \ as the confdir and ssl dir\n\n  You must have the conf directory setup, it will\
  \ not be populated - map to /etc/puppetlabs/puppet\n  You must have the code directory\
  \ setup, it will not be created - map to /etc/puppetlabs/code\n  However an empty\
  \ SSL directory is fine, puppet will set this up.\n\n  Also include puppet-lint\
  \ in case you want to check in the docker container.\n  Also includes perl for a\
  \ script I run on puppetmaster for staggering puppet run times."
