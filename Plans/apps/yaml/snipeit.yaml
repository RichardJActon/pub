Overview: "This is a FOSS project for asset management in IT Operations. Knowing who\
  \ has which laptop, when it was purchased in order to depreciate it correctly, handling\
  \ software licenses, etc.\r\n\r\nIt is built on Laravel 5.5.\r\n\r\nSnipe-IT is\
  \ actively developed and we release quite frequently. (Check out the live demo here.)\r\
  \n\r\nThis is web-based software. This means there is no executable file (aka no\
  \ .exe files), and it must be run on a web server and accessed through a web browser.\
  \ It runs on any Mac OSX, flavor of Linux, as well as Windows, and we have a Docker\
  \ image available if that's what you're into."
