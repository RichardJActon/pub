Overview: "The official Tachidesk Docker-Container.\r\n\r\nUnless  specified otherwise\
  \ everything gets saved in the appdata folder.\r\nThe Container has a specified\
  \ User inside. On Unraid this can lead to errors if the User is nonexistent on the\
  \ Hostsystem. I haven't found a easy workaround yet but the specified User PUID\
  \ is 1000 which on Unraid is the first User created when using the Users option\
  \ in the GUI to add a user. So you could create a new user if you get errors but\
  \ it feels very sketchy. Also note that the Docker will write it's files with that\
  \ PUID.\n\r\n\r\nRead the Readme's first.\r\nTachidesk: https://github.com/Suwayomi/Tachidesk-Server\r\

  \n\r\nA free and open source manga reader server that runs extensions built for\
  \ Tachiyomi.\r\n\r\nTachidesk is an independent Tachiyomi compatible software and\
  \ is not a Fork of Tachiyomi.\r\n\r\nTachidesk is a general term used to describe\
  \ the combination of Tachidesk-Server(this project) and one of our clients. Think\
  \ of it roughly like the concept of \"distribution\" in GNU/Linux distributions,\
  \ in which Linux(Tachidesk-Server) is the kernel and the difference is which desktop\
  \ environment(Tachidesk client) you get with it.\r\n\r\nTachidesk-Server is as multi-platform\
  \ as you can get. Any platform that runs java and/or has a modern browser can run\
  \ it. This includes Windows, Linux, macOS, chrome OS, etc. Follow Downloading and\
  \ Running the app for installation instructions.\r\n\r\nAbility to sync with Tachiyomi\
  \ is a planned feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Excert from official Tachidesk-Docker Readme.\
  \ Accessed 05.11.2021 (https://github.com/suwayomi/docker-tachidesk))\r\n\r\nRun\
  \ Tachidesk server inside docker container as non-root user. The server will be\
  \ running on http://localhost:4567 open this url in your browser.\r\n\r\nDocker\
