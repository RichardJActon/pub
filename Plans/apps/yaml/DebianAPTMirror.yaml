Overview: "This container will run apt-mirror and Apache2. This allows you to create\
  \ a local apt mirror for Debian packages.\r\n\r\nOn the first run you will have\
  \ to edit the mirror.list that lives in your CONFIG_DIR which repositories you want\
  \ to sync and eventually other settings like the threads to use for downloading,...\
  \ and restart the container (keep an eye on the logs the container will tell you\
  \ what to do).\r\n\r\n**ATTENTION/WARNING:** Keep in mind that the first sync can\
  \ take very long depending on how much repositories you've selected to sync (stable\
  \ main contrib non-free: Will need about 200GB of hard drive space!).\r\n\r\n**Update\
  \ from the mirror files:** By default a cron job will run every day at 1am that\
  \ will run apt-mirror and update your mirror.\r\n\r\n**Mirror address:** The default\
  \ address for the mirror is 'http://ipFROMtheCONTAINER:980'\r\nAdd something like\
  \ this to your '/etc/apt/sources.list': 'deb http://ipFROMtheCONTAINER:980/debian\
  \ stable main contrib non-free'"
