      Description: Wallet address for receiving mined coin. If you are privacy conscious,
        you can redact this in logs posted to the support thread by replacing it with
        *****WALLET*****. If you use Monero, sharing this address will only allow
        people to send you Monero and possibly identify you if you send someone else
        Monero, but being a privacy oriented coin it's entirely up to you.

    workername:
      Default: Unraid
      Description: Enter a name for your worker. Some pools use a hidden option with
        this (Nanopool included) that allows you to change your payment threshold
        on their website. If you want to use this option, you can change this to 'workername/email',
        eg. 'Unraid/test@example.com', where test@example.com is your own email address.
        This option is basically a password. Please take note that if you post your
        logs in the support thread you would be best to redact the email address,
        eg. change out the instances of your email with ***@***.*** to prevent your
        email address being posted in a public forum.
