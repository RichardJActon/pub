Overview: "UrBackup is an easy to setup Open Source client/server backup system, that\
  \ through a combination of image and file backups accomplishes both data safety\
  \ and a fast restoration time.\n    File and image backups are made while the system\
  \ is running without interrupting current processes.\n    UrBackup also continuously\
  \ watches folders you want backed up in order to quickly find differences to previous\
  \ backups. Because of that, incremental file backups are really fast.\n    Your\
  \ files can be restored through the web interface, via the client or the Windows\
  \ Explorer while the backups of drive volumes can be restored with a bootable CD\
  \ or USB-Stick (bare metal restore).\n    A web interface makes setting up your\
  \ own backup server really easy."
