Overview: "Unofficial image of Bitfocus companion, update to latest stable once a\
  \ month.\r\n\r\nBitfocus Companion enables the reasonably priced Elgato Streamdeck\
  \ to be a professional shotbox surface for an increasing amount of different presentation\
  \ switchers, video playback software and broadcast equipment.\r\n\r\nYou don't need\
  \ an actual stream deck to use it. Companion both comes with a builtin stream deck\
  \ emulator, a webpage for touch screens and the ability to trigger buttons via OSC,\
  \ TCP, UDP, HTTP, WebSocket and ArtNet. It does the same job, just without the buttons."
