ModeratorComment: Due to changes made by Code42, CrashPlan Home version no longer
  functions as of Oct 22.  If you wish to continue using CrashPlan, you will have
  to switch to the CrashPlan Pro application.
Name: CrashPlan
Overview: "CrashPlan makes it easy to protect your digital life, so you can get back\
  \ to\nwhat\u2019s important in real life.  Only CrashPlan offers totally free local\
  \ and\noffsite backup. A subscription to the cloud backup service gets you continuous\n\
  backup, mobile file access and lots more. For the ultimate in computer backup,\n\
  get all three, from the same easy application.\n\nThe GUI of the application is\
  \ accessed through a modern web browser (no installation or configuration needed\
  \ on the client side) or via any VNC client.\n\nAlso, being based on Alpine Linux,\
  \ size of this container is very small (less\nthan 160MB in download size).\n\n\
  For a complete documentation of this container, see\nhttps://github.com/jlesage/docker-crashplan/blob/master/README.md\n\
  \n**Warning**: Make sure to read the *Taking Over Existing Backup* section from\n\
  the documentation if you are installing this container to replace another\nCrashPlan\
  \ installation (from Windows, Linux, Mac or even another Docker\ncontainer)."
