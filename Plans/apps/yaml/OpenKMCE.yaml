Overview: "DESCRIPTION\r\nThis is a docker template for OpenKM Community Edition,\
  \ an Open Source Document Management System (DMS). It provides a web interface for\
  \ managing nonspecific files.\r\n\r\nOpenKM is a management solution that allows\
  \ businesses to control the production, storage, management and distribution of\
  \ electronic documents, yielding greater effectiveness and the ability to reuse\
  \ information and to control the flow of the documents.\r\n\r\nThe CE version of\
  \ OpenKM doesn't have any trial period or something similar. It's the Open Source\
  \ version (free) developed and maintained by the public community, but with the\
  \ lack of some of the features that are only available in the Cloud or Professional\
  \ editions (paid). But, with some little tricks and programming skills, the user\
  \ can modify its source code (public).\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\u2022 The program has a\
  \ built-in SQLite DB (embedded), but if you're going to use it for production it's\
  \ highly recommended to connect it to an external DB, such as: MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL\
  \ (and others). By default, if no database is configured to connect to the OpenKM\
  \ instance, it will use the integrated one.\r\n\u2022 Both, 'OpenKM.cfg' and 'server.xml'\
  \ files, MUST be present and properly configured before creating the container.\r\
  \n\u2022 The 'Repository (data)' is the storage location for all the data (docs)\
  \ uploaded through the platform.\r\n\u2022 If there is a new image version and you\
  \ want to update it to the latest (tag), you will need to backup all the data (repo,\
  \ metadata, DB...) before proceeding with the process. DO NOT update if you didn't\
  \ back up previous installation.\r\n\u2022 The default credentials are: okmAdmin/admin\
  \ (Administrator).\r\n\u2022 The '/HOST_SWAP' directory is mapped to the internal\
  \ storage of the container to allow communication between the container and the\
  \ host. It will be usefull in case of exporting repo (zip) or any file from within\
  \ the platform, to the host. (optional field)\r\n\r\nVERSION\r\n1.0 (2021-11-30)\r\
  \n\r\nIMAGE TAG TEMPORARILY LOCKED AT 6.3.8 UNTIL FIXING SOME BUILDING ERRORS FOR\
  \ 6.3.11"
