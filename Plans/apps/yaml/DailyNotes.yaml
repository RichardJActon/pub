Overview: "App for taking notes and tracking tasks on a daily basis.\n\r\rThe idea\
  \ for this app came from using my Hobonichi Techo planner every morning to write\
  \ down what I needed to accomplish that day & using it for scratching down random\
  \ thoughts and notes as the day went on. The closest thing I've seen to an app for\
  \ replacing this system is Noteplan, but I don't use a Mac or an iOS device, and\
  \ it's not self-hostable, so I decided to write my own.\n\r\rSince I had the need\
  \ for keeping track of to-dos throughout the day, regular Markdown didn't work for\
  \ me since it doesn't natively support tasks. So as an alternative I'm using Github\
  \ Flavored Markdown (GFM). I really wanted it to feel like an actual text editor\
  \ and not just a textbox, so I decided to use CodeMirror to handle all the input.\
  \ Fira Code is used to provide font ligatures. Some other nice features include\
  \ code highlighting, text/code folding, and a task list where you can toggle the\
  \ status of any task from any date or note."
