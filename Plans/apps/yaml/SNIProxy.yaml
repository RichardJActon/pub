ModeratorComment: Deprecated in favour of Lan Cache from Josh.5
Name: SNIProxy
Network: bridge
Networking:
  Mode: bridge
Overview: "When running a LAN Cache and overriding DNS entries, there are some services\
  \ including the Origin launcher which will try and use HTTPS to talk to one of the\
  \ hostnames that are being overridden.\n\tThis breaks updates to the Origin client.\
  \ The solution is to run this container SNI Proxy. This accepts the HTTPS requests,\
  \ looks at the host being requested and sends the request on to the correct server.\n\
  \tPlease see https://squishedmooo.com/?p=1 for install instructions! You will need\
  \ them!"
