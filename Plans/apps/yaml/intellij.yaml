Overview: 'IntelliJ IDEA is a special programming environment or integrated development
  environment (IDE) largely meant for Java. This environment is used especially for
  the development of programs. It is developed by a company called JetBrains, which
  was formally called IntelliJ. It is available in two editions: the Community Edition
  which is licensed by Apache 2.0, and a commercial edition known as the Ultimate
  Edition. Both of them can be used for creating software which can be sold. What
  makes IntelliJ IDEA so different from its counterparts is its ease of use, flexibility
  and its solid design. This Docker Image includes Git for SCM and Scala, Kotlin and
  Groovy programming languages.'
