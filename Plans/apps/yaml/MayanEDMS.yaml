Overview: "DESCRIPTION\r\nMayan EDMS, often simply \"Mayan\", is an electronic document\
  \ management system with an emphasis on automation.\r\n\r\nAs a document manager\
  \ its main purpose is to store, introspect, and categorize files, with a strong\
  \ emphasis on preserving the contextual and business information of documents. It\
  \ also provide means to ease retrieval, as requested by users or other software\
  \ applications, be it those on the same computer or those running on another computer\
  \ across a network (including the Internet). It can handle workloads ranging from\
  \ small single-machine applications to large enterprise applications with many concurrent\
  \ users. It can also OCR, preview, label, sign, send, and receive documents. Other\
  \ features of interest are its workflow system, role based access control, and REST\
  \ API.\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\u2022 The program has a built-in SQLite DB (embedded), but\
  \ if you're going to use it for production it's highly recommended to connect it\
  \ to an external DB, such as: MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL (and others). By default,\
  \ if no database is configured to connect to the Mayan EDMS instance, it will use\
  \ the integrated one.\r\n\u2022 The default credentials are auto-generated when\
  \ the container gets built. Just open WebUI and you will see them up.\r\n\r\nVERSION\r\
  \n1.0 (2021-12-01)"
