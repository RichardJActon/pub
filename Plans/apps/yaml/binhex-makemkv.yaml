Overview: MakeMKV is your one-click solution to convert video that you own into free
  and patents-unencumbered format that can be played everywhere. MakeMKV is a format
  converter, otherwise called "transcoder". It converts the video clips from proprietary
  (and usually encrypted) disc into a set of MKV files, preserving most information
  but not changing it in any way. The MKV format can store multiple video/audio tracks
  with all meta-information and preserve chapters. There are many players that can
  play MKV files nearly on all platforms, and there are tools to convert MKV files
  to many formats, including DVD and Blu-ray discs.
