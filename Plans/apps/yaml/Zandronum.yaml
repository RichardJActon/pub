Overview: "This Docker will download and install Zandronum Server and run it.\r\n\r\
  \nZandronum brings classic Doom into the 21st century, maintaining the essence of\
  \ what has made Doom great for so many years and, at the same time, adding new features\
  \ to modernize it, creating a fresh, fun new experience.\r\n\r\nATTENTION: You have\
  \ to place your wad files into the '/wads' folder to complete the startup of the\
  \ server (If you place more than one wad file in the folder you have to append the\
  \ GAME_PARAMS with for example: '-iwad DOOM2.WAD' - without quotes - to load like\
  \ in this example DOOM2, also note that the wad file is case sensitive)."
