Overview: "Private networks made easy\r\n\r\nConnect all your devices using WireGuard,\xAE\
  \ without the hassle.\r\nTailscale makes it as easy as installing an app and signing\
  \ in.\r\n\r\nThis container sets up tailscale for unraid.\r\n\r\nIt will register\
  \ as hostname unraid, if you want to change that see 'Extra Parameters' below and\
  \ change to the hostname you would like.\r\n\r\n** IMPORTANT When you first start\
  \ this container you must check the log file for the logon URL and then enter it\
  \ into a browser and logon to tail scale. I would then also advise setting the keys\
  \ to not expire for your unraid host **\r\n\r\n** Note that this will expose your\
  \ whole server into your tailscale VPN network ** \r\nDo not do this if you do not\
  \ understand what that means."
