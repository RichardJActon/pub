Overview: "The exceptionally handsome dashboard framework.[br][br]\n    Dashing is\
  \ a Sinatra based framework that lets you build beautiful dashboards.[br][br]\n\
  \    Use premade widgets, or fully create your own with scss, html, and coffeescript.[br]\n\
  \    Widgets harness the power of data bindings to keep things DRY and simple. Powered\
  \ by batman.js.[br]\n    Use the API to push data to your dashboards, or make use\
  \ of a simple ruby DSL for fetching data.[br]\n    Drag and Drop interface for re-arranging\
  \ your widgets.[br][br]\n    [b][span style='color: #E80000;']Directions:[/span][/b][br]\n\
  \    [b]/config[/b] : Dashing stores it's configuration files here.[br]\n    A sample\
  \ dashboard is installed - edit [b]start.sh[/b] to point to your own.[br][br]\n\
  \    *** It takes a couple of minutes to start the first time as it downloads additional\
  \ files ***[br][br]"
