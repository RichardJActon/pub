Overview: "Airsonic-Advanced is a more modern implementation of the Airsonic fork\
  \ with several key performance and feature enhancements. It adds and supersedes\
  \ several features in Airsonic.[br][br]\n    Airsonic is a free, web-based media\
  \ streamer, providing ubiquitious access to your music. Use it to share your music\
  \ with friends, or to listen to your own music while at work. You can stream to\
  \ multiple players simultaneously, for instance to one player in your kitchen and\
  \ another in your living room.[br]\n    Airsonic is designed to handle very large\
  \ music collections (hundreds of gigabytes). Although optimized for MP3 streaming,\
  \ it works for any audio or video format that can stream over HTTP, for instance\
  \ AAC and OGG. By using transcoder plug-ins, Airsonic supports on-the-fly conversion\
  \ and streaming of virtually any audio format, including WMA, FLAC, APE, Musepack,\
  \ WavPck and Shorten.[br]\n    If you have constrained bandwidth, you may set an\
  \ upper limit for the bitrate of the music streams. Airsonic will then automatically\
  \ resample the music to a suitable bitrate.[br]\n    In addition to being a streaming\
  \ media server, Airsonic works very well as a local jukebox. The intuitive web interface,\
  \ as well as search and index facilities, are optimized for efficient browsing through\
  \ large media libraries. Airsonic also comes with an integrated Podcast receiver,\
  \ with many of the same features as you find in iTunes.[br]\n    Based on Java technology,\
  \ Airsonic runs on most platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux and Unix variants.[br][br]"
