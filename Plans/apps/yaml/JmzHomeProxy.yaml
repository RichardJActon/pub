Overview: "Proxy is in quotes because I couldn't think of a better name. There is\
  \ nothing overly special about this other than using it as a simple and easy to\
  \ use dashboard for all your self-hosted services.\r\n\r\nOnly caveat to using this,\
  \ is that if you host this on public facing server and use https then the services\
  \ you are adding to it must be https also due to iframe restrictions."
