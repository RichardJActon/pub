Overview: "This takes ESPN+ and transforms it into a \"live TV\" experience with virtual\
  \ linear channels. It will discover what is on, and generate a schedule of channels\
  \ that will give you M3U and XMLTV files that you can import into something like\
  \ Jellyfin or VLC.\r\n\r\n=== Notes ===\r\n * This was not made for pirating streams.\
  \ This is made for using your own credentials and have a different presentation\
  \ than the ESPN+ app currently gives.\r\n * Currently this software is in a very\
  \ beta state. It hasn't been fully tested and relies on some lame workarounds to\
  \ get the data needed to start a stream. There are some questions about how boundies\
  \ work when a scheduled entry ends or when a new entry starts if it will pick it\
  \ up automatically.\r\n * The Mouse might not like it and it could be taken down\
  \ at any minute. Enjoy it while it lasts. \xAF\\\\(\u30C4)/\xAF"
