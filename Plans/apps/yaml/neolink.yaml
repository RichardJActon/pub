Overview: "Neolink is a small program that acts as a proxy between Reolink IP cameras\
  \ and normal RTSP clients. Certain cameras, such as the Reolink B800, do not implement\
  \ ONVIF or RTSP, but instead use a proprietary \"Baichuan\" protocol only compatible\
  \ with their apps and NVRs (any camera that uses \"port 9000\" will likely be using\
  \ this protocol).\r\n\r\nNOTE: See the GitHub Repo for examples for setting up your\
  \ appdata/neolink/config.toml file for each camera.  https://github.com/thirtythreeforty/neolink\r\
  \n\r\nNeolink allows you to use NVR software such as Shinobi or Blue Iris to receive\
  \ video from these cameras instead. The Reolink NVR is not required, and the cameras\
  \ are unmodified. Your NVR software connects to Neolink, which forwards the video\
  \ stream from the camera.\r\n\r\nThe Neolink project is not affiliated with Reolink\
  \ in any way; everything it does has been reverse engineered."
