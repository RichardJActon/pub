Overview: "Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that\
  \ is damn vulnerable. Its main goal is to be an aid for security professionals to\
  \ test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better\
  \ understand the processes of securing web applications and to aid both students\
  \ &amp; teachers to learn about web application security in a controlled class room\
  \ environment.\r\n\r\nThe aim of DVWA is to practice some of the most common web\
  \ vulnerabilities, with various levels of difficulty, with a simple straightforward\
  \ interface. Please note, there are both documented and undocumented vulnerabilities\
  \ with this software. This is intentional. You are encouraged to try and discover\
  \ as many issues as possible.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Download the config.inc.php file from\
  \ https://github.com/natcoso9955/unRAID-docker/blob/master/configs/DVWA/config.inc.php\
  \ before you start the container.\r\nWill need to be placed into your config path.\r\
  \n\r\nYou will also need to place https://github.com/natcoso9955/unRAID-docker/blob/master/configs/DVWA/php.ini\
  \ in the root of your appdata path."
