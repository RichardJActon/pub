Overview: 'Jellyfin is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control of managing
  and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex,
  to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps.
  Jellyfin is descended from Emby''s 3.5.2 release and ported to the .NET Core framework
  to enable full cross-platform support. There are no strings attached, no premium
  licenses or features, and no hidden agendas: just a team who want to build something
  better and work together to achieve it.'
