description: A container management platform built for organizations that deploy containers
  in production. The docker version of Rancher cannot be made HA (Highly Available),
  however the clusters it creates can be. It is also possible to connect to and use
  clusters created by rancher when it is down. Useful as a management interface for
  deploying, scaling, and editting apps on other systems. (in the cloud, a raspberry
  pi cluster, vms running k3os, etc.) Perfect for running and managing the apps that
  you'd rather not go down while maintaining your server.
