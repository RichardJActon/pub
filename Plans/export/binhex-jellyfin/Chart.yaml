description: 'Jellyfin is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control of
  managing and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby
  and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple
  apps. Jellyfin is descended from Emby''s 3.5.2 release and ported to the .NET Core
  framework to enable full cross-platform support. There are no strings attached,
  no premium licenses or features, and no hidden agendas: just a team who want to
  build something better and work together to achieve it.'
