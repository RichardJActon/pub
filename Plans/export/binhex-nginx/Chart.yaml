description: NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching,
  load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed
  for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities,
  NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a
  reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.
