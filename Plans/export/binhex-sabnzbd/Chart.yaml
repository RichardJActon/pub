description: SABnzbd is an Open Source Binary Newsreader written in Python. SABnzbd
  makes Usenet as simple and streamlined as possible by automating everything we can.
  All you have to do is add an .nzb. SABnzbd takes over from there, where it will
  be automatically downloaded, verified, repaired, extracted and filed away with zero
  human interaction.
