description: "Neolink is a small program that acts as a proxy between Reolink IP cameras\
  \ and normal RTSP clients. Certain cameras, such as the Reolink B800, do not implement\
  \ ONVIF or RTSP, but instead use a proprietary \"Baichuan\" protocol only compatible\
  \ with their apps and NVRs (any camera that uses \"port 9000\" will likely be using\
  \ this protocol).\r\n"
