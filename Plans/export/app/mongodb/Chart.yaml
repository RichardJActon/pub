description: '[h3]MongoDB[/h3]MongoDB (from "humongous") is a cross-platform document-oriented
  database. Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table-based
  relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas
  (MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the integration of data in certain types
  of applications easier and faster. Released under a combination of the GNU Affero
  General Public License and the Apache License, MongoDB is free and open-source software.'
