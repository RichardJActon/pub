description: TeamSpeak is proprietary voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) software
  that allows computer users to speak on a chat channel with fellow computer users,
  much like a telephone conference call. A TeamSpeak user will often wear a headset
  with an integrated microphone. Users use the TeamSpeak client software to connect
  to a TeamSpeak server of their choice, from there they can join chat channels and
  discuss things.
