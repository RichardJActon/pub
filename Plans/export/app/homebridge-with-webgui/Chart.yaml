description: 'Homebridge with GUI (default user:pass=admin:admin) is a lightweight
  NodeJS server you can run on your home network that emulates the iOS HomeKit API.
  It supports Plugins, which are community-contributed modules that provide a basic
  bridge from HomeKit to various 3rd-party APIs provided by manufacturers of "smart
  home" devices.
