  \ and Windows. It uses \u200Blibtorrent in its backend and features multiple user-interfaces\
  \ including: GTK+, web and console. It has been designed using the client server\
  \ model with a daemon process that handles all the bittorrent activity. The Deluge\
  \ daemon is able to run on headless machines with the user-interfaces being able\
  \ to connect remotely from any platform.\n"
