description: Readarr is an ebook and audiobook collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent
  users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new books from your favorite authors
  and will grab, sort and rename them. Note that only one type of a given book is
  supported. If you want both an audiobook and ebook of a given book you will need
  multiple instances.
