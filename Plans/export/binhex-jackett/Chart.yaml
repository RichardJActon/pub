description: Jackett works as a proxy server - it translates queries from apps (Sonarr,
  Radarr, SickRage, CouchPotato, Mylar, DuckieTV, etc) into tracker-site-specific
  http queries, parses the html response, then sends results back to the requesting
  software. This allows for getting recent uploads (like RSS) and performing searches.
  Jackett is a single repository of maintained indexer scraping and translation logic
    - removing the burden from other apps.
