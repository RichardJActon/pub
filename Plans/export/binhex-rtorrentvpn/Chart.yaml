description: 'rTorrent is a quick and efficient BitTorrent client that uses, and is
  in development alongside, the libTorrent (not to be confused with libtorrent-rasterbar)
  library. It is written in C++ and uses the ncurses programming library, which means
  it uses a text user interface. When combined with a terminal multiplexer (e.g. GNU
  Screen or Tmux) and Secure Shell, it becomes a convenient remote BitTorrent client,
  this Docker image includes the popular ruTorrent web frontend to rTorrent for ease
  of use.
