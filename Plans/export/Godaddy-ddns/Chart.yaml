description: Docker image to provide a DDNS service for godaddy domains. Uses the
  GoDaddy REST API to update the given domain's DNS IP address to the public IP address
  of the host it is executing on. Performs a check every 10 minutes, but you can alter
  this if you like by modifying /etc/cron.d/godaddy-ddns inside the container.
