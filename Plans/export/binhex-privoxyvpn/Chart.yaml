  for enhancing privacy, manipulating cookies and modifying web page data and HTTP
  headers before the page is rendered by the browser. Privoxy is a "privacy enhancing
  proxy", filtering web pages and removing advertisements. Privoxy can be customized
  by users, for both stand-alone systems and multi-user networks. Privoxy can be chained
  to other proxies and is frequently used in combination with Squid and can be used
