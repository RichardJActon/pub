  \ authenticating users who request protected resources from servers proxied by nginx.\
  \ It includes a daemon (ldap-auth) that communicates with an authentication server,\
  \ and a webserver daemon that generates an authentication cookie based on the user\u2019\

  \ Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication server (OpenLDAP or Microsoft Windows Active\
  \ Directory 2003 and 2012)."
