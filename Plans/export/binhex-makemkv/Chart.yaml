description: MakeMKV is your one-click solution to convert video that you own into
  free and patents-unencumbered format that can be played everywhere. MakeMKV is a
  format converter, otherwise called "transcoder". It converts the video clips from
  proprietary (and usually encrypted) disc into a set of MKV files, preserving most
  information but not changing it in any way. The MKV format can store multiple video/audio
  tracks with all meta-information and preserve chapters. There are many players that
  can play MKV files nearly on all platforms, and there are tools to convert MKV files
  to many formats, including DVD and Blu-ray discs.
